# Intro
The cost of living is a significant economic burden on more and more people in the world. One of the means to alleviate the cost of living is the ability to check and compare prices in a convenient and easy way, which allows for wise consumer purchase of any basket of products.

The development of the world and technology makes it possible to bring together store owners and consumers, and create a digital arena in which the consumer can, on the one hand, make quick and easy price comparisons, and on the other hand, create exposure of stores to different consumers who were previously unaware of their existence.

SDMarket allows you to set up stores that sell various items and will allow the consumer to order these items, while the system performs the ideal price comparison according to the consumer's requirements. 

# About
SDMarket is a web application that will offer users a convenient platform for purchasing items from virtual stores across the network.

Users who own stores in a particular area will be able to formulate the information about their stores, discount offers, and items that they sell in the app's XML file, upload it to the site, thus making it available to potential customers.
This way, casual customers in the area will be able to purchase products from it cheaply and faithfully.

At the same time, in order not to encourage monopolies, we will also allow other store owners to open virtual stores in a particular area and thus "compete" with the original store owners in supplying cheap items.
